%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Future Generation Computer Systems}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{Kary Ocaña et al.}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.  Contact the journal editorial office if in any doubt
\jid{procs}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
\jnltitlelogo{FGCS}

%% Provide the copyright line to appear in the abstract
%% Usage:
%   \CopyrightLine[<text-before-year>]{<year>}{<restt-of-the-copyright-text>}
%   \CopyrightLine[Crown copyright]{2011}{Published by Elsevier Ltd.}

\begin{abstract}

%
Science gateways are software solutions that bring out the integration of reusable data and specialised techniques – as workflow, security and management mechanisms – via web servers while hiding complex resources and services of high performance computing (HPC). Biological sciences are undergoing a revolution. Bioinformatics covers a wide range of important applications in health, diversity, and life sciences. Biological sciences are undergoing a revolution since novel technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) allow data generation in exascale dimensions and HPC has accelerated the transition of computational simulation of biological systems at all scales. We introduce \system, a science gateway that integrates a suite of bioinformatics applications to open the utilisation of HPC infrastructure of the Brazilian National HPC System (SINAPAD), by providing a customised easy-to-use interface to access large data and computational management resources. The present paper aims at describing experiences of integrating the science gateway \system in the Brazilian HPC resources. We address challenges of designing/executing bioinformatics applications in our multiuser computational platform for performing parallel and distributed large-scale executions. \system was evaluated based on studies of performance and scalability of applications in the HPC environments, as clusters of supercomputers. In addition, machine learning analyses were applied for recommending features for the efficient allocation of resources. Features such as the type of clusters, number of cores, input data size, and historical performance results of bioinformatics applications were used for generating the predictive models. In the experiments, the hybrid version of RAxML improves the speedup significantly while maintaining efficiency over 75\%.
