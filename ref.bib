These workflows are procedures consisting of a series of computational tasks using web services, which may be performed on data from its retrieval, integration and analysis, to the visualization of the results. As a public repository of workflows, myExperiment allows anybody to discover those that are relevant to their research, which can then be reused and repurposed to their specific requirements. Conversely, developers can submit their workflows to myExperiment and enable them to be shared in a secure manner. Since its release in 2007, myExperiment currently has over 3500 registered users and contains more than 1000 workflows. The social aspect to the sharing of these workflows is facilitated by registered users forming virtual communities bound together by a common interest or research project. Contributors of workflows can build their reputation within these communities by receiving feedback and credit from individuals who reuse their work. Further documentation about myExperiment including its REST web service is available from http://wiki.myexperiment.org. Feedback and requests for support can be sent to bugs@myexperiment.org.}",

Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain. Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists. We discuss such challenges and suggest developing holistic and meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge deep learning models and human interpretability.}",

abstract = "Compute-intensive simulations are often based on complex scientific theories and necessitate high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures to deliver results in reasonable time. While domain researchers are experts in their field and apply sophisticated theoretical models in computational simulations, they are not necessarily also HPC experts or IT specialists in general. Thus, they appreciate easy-to-use solutions tailored to their research, which hide the complex underlying computing and data infrastructures. Science gateways form such end-to-end solutions and their development for compute-intensive simulations necessitates expertise to connect HPC research infrastructures including grid and cloud infrastructures to support with the efficient access to such resources. HPC experts and IT specialists fulfilling this task may have only rudimentary knowledge about the research domain of a simulation. Thus, it is crucial that they gather the requirements of a research use case, which they aim to support efficiently via a science gateway. In the last 10 years quite a few web development frameworks, science gateway frameworks and APIs with different foci and strengths have evolved to support the developers of science gateways in implementing an intuitive solution for a target research domain. The selection of a suitable technology for a specific use case is essential and helps reducing the effort in implementing the science gateway by re-using existing software or frameworks. Thus, a solution for a user community can be provided more efficiently. This paper introduces the general architecture of science gateways, goes into detail for criteria to design science gateways efficiently and gives examples of mature science gateways and science gateway frameworks."

    abstract = { “Grid” computing has emerged as an important new field, distinguished from conventional distributed computing by its focus on large-scale resource sharing, innovative applications, and, in some cases, high performance orientation. In this article, the authors define this new field. First, they review the “Grid problem,” which is defined as flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources—what is referred to as virtual organizations. In such settings, unique authentication, authorization, resource access, resource discovery, and other challenges are encountered. It is this class of problem that is addressed by Grid technologies. Next, the authors present an extensible and open Grid architecture, in which protocols, services, application programming interfaces, and software development kits are categorized according to their roles in enabling resource sharing. The authors describe requirements that they believe any such mechanisms must satisfy and discuss the importance of defining a compact set of intergrid protocols to enable interoperability among different Grid systems. Finally, the authors discuss how Grid technologies relate to other contemporary technologies, including enterprise integration, application service provider, storage service provider, and peer-to-peer computing. They maintain that Grid concepts and technologies complement and have much to contribute to these other approaches. }

This activity requires complex orchestration and data management as data is passed to, from, and among application invocations. Distributed and parallel computing resources can accelerate such processing, but their use further increases programming complexity. The Swift parallel scripting language reduces these complexities by making file system structures accessible via language constructs and by allowing ordinary application programs to be composed into powerful parallel scripts that can efficiently utilize parallel and distributed resources. We present Swift’s implicitly parallel and deterministic programming model, which applies external applications to file collections using a functional style that abstracts and simplifies distributed parallel execution."

abstract = {SummaryArguably, an important amount of scientific software development time is likely to be employed on user interfaces. In particular, science gateways have gained increasing interest from the e-Science community. These gateways allow hiding the complexity of the underlying resources that give support to the management of scientific data and to the execution of scientific applications. Based on our previous experience with the development of science gateways for diverse application domains in the Brazilian national high-performance computing network (SINAPAD), we have devised a rapid prototyping strategy to lower the barrier for scientific application developers to launch new science gateways. This strategy is based on two main tools. The first tool implements a gateway engine that can be configured by a small set of XML files. Such files completely define the desired functionality of a specific science gateway in the gateway engine. The gateway engine also offers other features not commonly found in related technologies, such as file sharing, data provenance tracking, and restricted anonymous access to underlying computational resources. The second tool implements both an editor and a packager for the aforementioned engine. This tool allows the developer to rapidly deploy and launch a new science gateway in ordinary Web application containers. In this paper, we present our results with the use of both tools in the SINAPAD network. We also discuss about the current limitations of both tools, as well as how we have been dealing with such limitations to provide a more comprehensive toolset to developers.

abstract = "High performance computing (HPC) scheduling landscape currently faces new challenges due to the changes in the workload. Previously, HPC centers were dominated by tightly coupled MPI jobs. HPC workloads increasingly include high-throughput, data-intensive, and stream-processing applications. As a consequence, workloads are becoming more diverse at both application and job levels, posing new challenges to classical HPC schedulers. There is a need to understand the current HPC workloads and their evolution to facilitate informed future scheduling research and enable efficient scheduling in future HPC systems. In this paper, we present a methodology to characterize workloads and assess their heterogeneity, at a particular time period and its evolution over time. We apply this methodology to the workloads of three systems (Hopper, Edison, and Carver) at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). We present the resulting characterization of jobs, queues, heterogeneity, and performance that includes detailed information of a year of workload (2014) and evolution through the systems’ lifetime (2010–2014)."

abstract = {A Migração Kirchhoff Pré-empilhamento em Tempo (ou PKTM, do inglês Pre-stack Kirchhoff Time Migration) é parte central do processo de exploração de petróleo. Como o PKTM é computacionalmente intensivo, muitos trabalhos propuseram o uso de aceleradores como GPU (Graphical Processing Units) para reduzir o seu tempo de execução. Embora os processadores modernos possuam um recurso de aceleração vetorial, apenas um trabalho avaliou o uso deste recurso para acelerar o PKTM. Contudo, este trabalho avaliou apenas a versão sequencial desta aplicação. Nesse trabalho, propõe-se uma analise da vetorização de duas versões paralelas do PKTM. Para a primeira versão paralela, foi utilizado OpenMP e para a segunda, foi utilizado MPI. Em relação à vetorização, foram consideradas a vetorização automática, executada pelo compilador, e a vetorização manual, implementada pelo programador. Uma análise experimental mostrou que a vetorização automática no código com o OpenMP produziu melhores resultados do que os obtidos no código sequencial e no código com MPI. Assim, foram propostas algumas otimizações que permitiram que as versões sequenciais e com MPI obtivessem um desempenho similar ao alcançado no código com OpenMP.},

This fact demands high performance computation and opens up for exploring new approaches to provide better control and performance when running experiments, including Phylogeny/Phylogenomics. We designed a phylogenetic scientific workflow, named SciPhy, to construct phylogenetic trees from a set of drug target enzymes found in protozoan genomes. Our contribution is the development, implementation and test of SciPhy in public cloud computing environments. SciPhy can be used in other Bioinformatics experiments to control a systematic execution with high performance while producing provenance data.",

abstract="This paper introduces a new representation for Boolean functions, called decision lists, and shows that they are efficiently learnable from examples. More precisely, this result is established for k-;DL -- the set of decision lists with conjunctive clauses of size k at each decision. Since k-DL properly includes other well-known techniques for representing Boolean functions such as k-CNF (formulae in conjunctive normal form with at most k literals per clause), k-DNF (formulae in disjunctive normal form with at most k literals per term), and decision trees of depth k, our result strictly increases the set of functions that are known to be polynomially learnable, in the sense of Valiant (1984). Our proof is constructive: we present an algorithm that can efficiently construct an element of k-DL consistent with a given set of examples, if one exists.",

abstract="In the last few years, cloud computing has emerged as a computational paradigm that enables scientists to build more complex scientific applications to manage large data sets or high-performance applications, based on distributed resources. By following this paradigm, scientists may use distributed resources (infrastructure, storage, databases, and applications) without having to deal with implementation or configuration details. In fact, there are many cloud computing environments already available for use. Despite its fast growth and adoption, the definition of cloud computing is not a consensus. This makes it very difficult to comprehend the cloud computing field as a whole, correlate, classify, and compare the various existing proposals. Over the years, taxonomy techniques have been used to create models that allow for the classification of concepts within a domain. The main objective of this chapter is to apply taxonomy techniques in the cloud computing domain. This chapter discusses many aspects involved with cloud computing that are important from a scientific perspective. It contributes by proposing a taxonomy based on characteristics that are fundamental for scientific applications typically associated with the cloud paradigm.",
